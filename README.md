# adverity_case
This repository contains a solution for the *Simple outlier detection* as a Jupyter notebook using python 3.8. The required libs are specified in `requirements.txt` and can be installed by running 
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
 in a virtual environment.

## Contents
In addition to the interactive Jupyter notebook, the output of the notebook is stored as a static HTML called `adverity_case.html` in the root of the project.

## Dataset
The dataset for this case is coming from https://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction. I've used the *training* dataset from the *Avazu Click-Through Rate Prediction* and stored the data under the `data/` directory
